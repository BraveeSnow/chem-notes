The **formula mass** of a substance represents the mass of a compound as a whole by taking its components into account.

## Calculating the Formula Mass

### …for Molecular Compounds

The formula for [[ionic_and_molecular_compounds#Molecular Compounds|molecular compounds]] represent the number of atoms present in each individual molecule. We can sum the masses of each type of atom to produce the formula mass. The formula mass is also equivalent to the **molecular mass** in this case.

> Example: Formula Mass of a Molecular Compound
> 
> Take the compound [chloroform](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/6212) which has the formula $\ce{CHCl_3}$. To find the formula mass, we need to find the atomic masses (found on the periodic table) and calculate the total mass as defined by its formula. The table below shows how this can be done.

| Element | Quantity | Average atomic mass (amu) | Subtotal (amu) |
| ------- | -------- |:------------------------- | -------------- |
| C       | 1        | 12.01                     | 12.01          |
| H       | 1        | 1.008                     | 1.008          |
| Cl      | 3        | 35.45                     | 106.35         |

> Adding the subtotals together gives us a total of 119.37 amu.

### …for Ionic Compounds

The formula mass for [[ionic_and_molecular_compounds#Ionic Compounds|ionic compounds]] is the same process as with covalent compounds; however, due to the difference in mass of their ionic components as compared to their neutral counterparts, the formula mass is *not* equivalent to its molecular mass.

With that being said, this can generally be ignored as the difference is miniscule.

## The Mole

The properties of a compound differ based on many factors: the types of bonds, its formula and even its atomic arrangement. So how do we measure them?

Introducing the **mole**. It is used to indicate the *number of atoms or molecules*. The equivalent of 1 mole is $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ atoms or molecules. This specific number is known as **Avogadro's number**. The mole is also directly related to the formula mass such that the formula mass (amu) is equivalent to the molar mass (g/mol).

*Keep in mind that they are only numerically equivalent and are on entirely different scales*.

### Calculations with the Molar Mass

Now that we know how to derive the molar mass from elements and compounds, it is important to know *how* to use it. It allows us to convert from grams to moles and vice versa. With the addition of Avogadro's number ($N_A$), we can find the number of atoms using the number of moles.

The formula below allows us to convert grams to moles and moles to grams. Rearrange the equation when needed.

> **Equation: Mass-to-Mole Conversion**
> $$m = nM$$
> $m$ = mass
> $n$ = number of moles
> $M$ = molar mass

In order to find the number of individual atoms/molecules, you need the number of moles and can calculate using the formula:
$$Atoms = nN_A$$

Given that saccharin has a molar mass of $\pu{183.18 g/mol}$, how many saccharin molecules are in a $\pu{40.0 mg}$ ($\pu{0.0400 g}$) sample of saccharin? How many carbon atoms are in the same sample?
```smiles
C1=CC=C2C(=C1)C(=O)NS2(=O)=O
```
Given that the molar mass is $\pu{183.18 g/mol}$, we can calculate the number of moles in $\pu{0.0400 g}$ and find the number of molecules.

$n = \frac{\pu{0.0400 g}}{\pu{183.18 g/mol}} = \pu{0.000218 mol}$
$\#_{molecules} = \pu{0.000218 mol} \times (6.022 \times 10^{23}) = 1.31 \times 10^{20}$

Now that we know the number of molecules, we multiply this number by the number of carbon atoms to get the total amount of carbon atoms.
