# Dalton's Atomic Theory

Published in 1807, Dalton hypothesized about the atomic structures of matter and is still valid in modern atomic theory. The following are propositions that are stated:

1. Matter is made of small particles known as atoms.
2. An element consists of one type of atom.
3. The properties of one element differ from others property-wise.
4. A compound consists of more than one element in a *whole-number* ratio.
5. During a reaction, atoms are rearranged instead of being destroyed.

## Laws of Definite and Multiple Proportions

The **law of definite proportions** states that a given compound will always have a fixed ratio of elements. This means each compound has a certain mass ratio for each element.

> **Example: The Law of Definite Proportions**
> 
> Sample A - 14.82g C, 2.78g H
> Sample B - 22.33g C, 4.19g H
> 
> Given the two samples above for a certain compound, check if they both follow the law of definite proportions by finding the mass ratio.
> $$
\begin{array}{rrr}
A =& \frac{14.82g \ C}{2.78g \ H} \times \frac{1}{2.78} =& \frac{5.33g \ C}{1.00g \ H} \\
B =& \frac{22.33g \ C}{4.19g \ H} \times \frac{1}{4.19} =& \frac{5.33g \ C}{1.00g \ H}
\end{array}$$
> We can determine that the carbon-hydrogen ratio of these two samples is 5.33:1, which adheres to the law of definite proportions.

Note that this will not work to identify if the samples are the same compound. For example, the molecules of [glucose](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5793) ($C_6H_{12}O_6$, left) will have the same mass ratio as [acetic acid](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/176) ($CH_3COOH$, right). Some even have the same chemical formula as other compounds but differ in the [[chemical_formulae#Arrangement of Molecules|arrangement of its atoms]].

The **law of multiple proportions** states that when two elements undergo a reaction to form more than one compound, the masses of both reactants form the new compound in a *whole-number ratio*.

> **Example: The Law of Multiple Proportions**
> 
> Sample A - 0.558g Cl to 1.00g Cu
> Sample B - 1.116g Cl to 1.00g Cu
> 
> Samples A and B react together to create a new compound but with different mass ratios. Taking the ratio of these ratios, we get:
> $$\frac{\frac{0.558g \ Cl}{1.00g \ Cu}}{\frac{1.116g \ Cl}{1.00g \ Cu}} = \frac{1}{2}$$
> We now know that sample B contains two times the amount of chlorine when compared to sample A, and we can conclude that there are twice as many chlorine atoms in sample B than in sample A.

## Examples

1. Given the compound samples below, is this an instance that proves the laws of definite and multiple proportions? What can you make out of the sample data?

Compound A - 4.27g C + 5.69g O
- Clear, colorless gas

Compound B - 5.19g C + 13.84g O
- Clear, colorless gas

As per the law of definite proportions, check the mass ratios of each compound:
$$
\begin{array}{rrr}
A =& \frac{4.27g \ C}{5.69g \ O} \times \frac{1}{4.27} =& \frac{1.00g \ C}{1.33g \ O} \\
B =& \frac{5.19g \ C}{13.84g \ O} \times \frac{1}{5.19} =& \frac{1.00g \ C}{2.67g \ O}
\end{array}
$$
It is obvious that these compounds are different as they have different mass ratios. Using the law of multiple proportions, we get the ratio:
$$\frac{\frac{1.00g \ C}{1.33g \ O}}{\frac{1.00g \ C}{2.67g \ O}} = \frac{2}{1}$$
It is clear that sample B contains twice as many oxygen atoms as sample A, which demonstrates that these samples prove the laws of definite and multiple proportions.

With some inference, these compounds may be [carbon monoxide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/281) (A) and [carbon dioxide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/280) (B).
