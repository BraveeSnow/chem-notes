# Chemical Nomenclature

In chemistry, **nomenclature** is important in how we name chemicals. There are sets of rules to abide by and differ depending on the type of compound.

## Inorganic Chemistry

To name an inorganic compound, we need to determine if we have an [[ionic_molecular_compounds#Ionic Compounds|ionic compound]] or [[ionic_molecular_compounds#Molecular Compounds|molecular compound]]. If ionic, does it have a fixed or variable charge? Is it monatomic or polyatomic? Otherwise, if molecular, does it consist of hydrogen and/or oxygen?

### Ionic Compounds

#### …with Monatomic Ions

Given a compound consisting of monatomic ions, we use the name of the [[ionic_molecular_compounds#Ionic & Molecular Compounds|cation]] followed by the name of the [[ionic_molecular_compounds#Ionic & Molecular Compounds|anion]] with the -ide suffix to replace its ending. For example:

- $NaCl$ - [Sodium chloride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABM6-Kxv-mk)
- $KBr$ - [Potassium bromide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/253877)
- $CaI_2$ - [Calcium iodide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/66244)
- $CsF$ - [Cesium fluoride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/25953)
- $LiCl$ - [Lithium chloride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/433294)

#### …with Polyatomic Ions

We use the same procedure as with monatomic ions except we don't add the -ide suffix. A reference of polyatomic ions can be found [[ionic_molecular_compounds#Polyatomic Ions|here]]. Here are some examples:

- $CH_3COOK$ - [Potassium acetate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Potassium-acetate)
- $NaHCO_3$ - [Sodium bicarbonate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/516892)
- $Al_2(CO_3)_3$ - [Aluminum carbonate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/10353966)

#### …with a Variable Charge

Many metals are able to form two or more cations with different charges. These compounds also use the same strategy as with monatomic ions, but include a roman numeral indicating the ionic charge.

As an example, iron has the ability to have ionic charges of 2+ and 3+. It is able to form $FeCl_2$ and $FeCl_3$ and are called [iron(II) chloride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/24458) and [iron(III) chloride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/24380), respectively. Here are more examples:

- $Hg_2O$ - [Mercury(I) oxide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/16683011)
- $HgO$ - [Mercury(II) oxide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/30856)
- $SnF_2$ - [Tin(II) fluoride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/24550)
- $SnF_4$ - [Tin(IV) fluoride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2723964)

Note that these compounds may have -ic (higher charge) or -ous (lower charge) suffixes, which are outdated. Taking the iron example, they would instead be called ferrous chloride and ferric chloride, respectfully.

#### Ionic Hydrates

Naming [[hydrates|hydrates]] have an additional rule. We add an additional name at the end of the anhydrous compound, which has a Greek prefix appended to the beginning of "hydrate". The table below shows the corresponding prefix for the number of water molecules.

| Number                | Prefix | Number | Prefix |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 (sometimes omitted) | mono-  | 6      | hexa-  |
| 2                     | di-    | 7      | hepta- |
| 3                     | tri-   | 8      | octa-  |
| 4                     | tetra- | 9      | nona-  |
| 5                     | penta- | 10     | deca-  |

Here are some examples:

- $CuSO_4 \cdot 5H_2O$ - [Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/24463)
- $Na_2CO_3 \cdot 10H_2O$ - [Sodium carbonate decahydrate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/151402)
