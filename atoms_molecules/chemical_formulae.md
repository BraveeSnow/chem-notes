# Chemical Formulae

There are a few types of formulae to represent a molecule. A **molecular formula** represents a molecule with the use of chemical symbols. They are also used as abbreviations for the names of compounds.

On the other hand, **structural formulae** are visual diagrams of the compound, including information on what type of bonds each atom makes to one another.

As an example, consider the compound [methane](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/methane). It has a molecular formula of $CH_4$ with a structural diagram below:
```smiles
[H]C([H])([H])[H]
```

Although you can't see the C for carbon in the diagram, it is implicit as indicated by the intersection. Hydrogen is also normally omitted, but will remain an exception for this example.

Many elements exist as only an individual atom, known as a **monatomic molecule**. Some elements exist in the world as **diatomic molecules** (two atoms) like $H_2$ and $O_2$; and others as **polyatomic molecules** (more than two) such as $S_8$, the most common form of sulfur.

An **empirical formula** is like a molecular formula, but it represents the *simplest whole-number ratio* of atoms. For example, take [benzene](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/241). It has a molecular formula of $C_6H_6$, but the empirical formula would be $CH$. As long as we know the molecular formula of a compound, an empirical formula can be derived from it.

## Arrangement of Molecules

It is important to note that compounds with the same chemical formula may differ from one another. Both [acetic acid](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/176) (left) and [methyl formate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/7865) (right) have a molecular formula of $C_2H_4O_2$, but differ in the arrangement of its atoms as seen below.

```smiles
CC(=O)O
COC=O
```

Almost like [[subatomic_particles#Isotopes|isotopes]], compounds with different structures are known as **isomers**. This particular isomer is specifically called a **structural isomer**. The other type is the **spacial isomer**, which have similar structures but with differences in its *orientation*.

An example of a spacial isomer is [carvone](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/7439), with R-(-)-carvone on the left and (S)-(+)-carvone on the right.
```smiles
CC1=CC[C@H](CC1=O)C(=C)C
CC1=CC[C@@H](CC1=O)C(=C)C
```

Note that the only difference with these two molecules is the lined and bolded triangle. This indicates that the bond is either further away (lined) or closer (bold) towards you. This minor difference actually changes the smell of carvone, which can be explained by [this video](https://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/mmg_disp.jsp?med_id=69373).

## Examples

1. Molecules of [glucose](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5793) contain 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms and 6 oxygen atoms. What are the molecular and empirical formulae for glucose?

The molecular formula for glucose is $C_6H_{12}O_6$.

The whole-number ratio of these atoms is 1:2:1. This yields $CH_2O$.

2. A molecule of [metaldehyde](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/61021) contains 8 carbon atoms, 16 hydrogen atoms and 4 oxygen atoms. What are the molecular and empirical formulae for metaldehyde?

The molecular formula for metaldehyde is $C_8H_{16}O_4$.

The whole-number ratio of these atoms is 2:4:1. This yields $C_2H_4O$.
