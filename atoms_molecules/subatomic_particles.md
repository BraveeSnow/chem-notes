Since matter is composed of atoms, we ask ourselves: are atoms the smallest particle to exist or are there smaller particles that make up the atom? With the use of a cathode ray tube, Joseph J. Thomson answers this question.

## The Charge-to-Mass Ratio

Using the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles, Thomson found out that the particles observed were lighter than the atom itself. This indicates that there is indeed smaller particles that make up the atom. This particular particle is now referred to as the **electron**.

The charge-to-mass ratio can be found using the kinematic equations below:
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
	t =& \frac{L}{v} \\
	a =& \frac{F}{m} & = \frac{qE}{m} \\
	y =& \frac{1}{2}at^2 & = \frac{1}{2}\frac{qE}{m} \left( \frac{L}{v} \right)^2 \\
\end{array}
$$

Thomson devised that if there was no deflection of electrons, that would mean the *electric* force and *magnetic* force were equivalent. Therefore:
$$
\begin{array}{rr}
qE =& qvB \\
v =& \frac{E}{B}
\end{array}
$$

Finally, we can substitute this new formula for velocity $v$ into the formula for electron deflection $y$:
$$y = \frac{1}{2}\frac{q}{m}\frac{L^2 B^2}{E}$$

Rearrange this equation to yield the charge-to-mass ratio gives us the final equation:
$$\frac{q}{m} = \frac{2yE}{B^2 L^2} = 1.759 \times 10^{11}C/kg$$

## The Charge of the Electron

Taking this further, Robert A. Milikan uncovered the charge of each electron via the [oil drop experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_drop_experiment). Each drop turned out to be a multiple of $1.6 \times 10^{-19}C$. Now that we know a single electron's charge along with the charge-to-mass ratio, we can find the mass of the electron:
$$m = 1.602 \times 10^{-19}C \frac{1kg}{1.759 \times 10^{11}C} = 9.107 \times 10^{-31}kg$$

## Visualizing the Atom

Many scientists have described the atom through the use of visuals, which has evolved overtime. The earliest descriptions of the atom were Thomson's plum pudding model (a) and Nagaoka's Saturn model (b).

Thomson states that since atoms are electrically neutral, there must be another subatomic particle with a positive charge which is now known as the **proton**. These particles are what compose the atom, with the atom being represented as the plum pudding model. Thomson at the time believed that the electrons and protons are of one body; Nagaoka, however, believed that the electrons and protons are separated like Saturn and its rings.

### The Rutherford Model

In 1909, Ernest Rutherford directed the [Geiger-Marsden experiments](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Geiger%E2%80%93Marsden_experiment) with Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden. These experiments utilized **alpha particles** produced by radium's radioactive decay. A beam of $\alpha$ particles were projected towards a thin piece of gold foil.

What was discovered was that most particles passed through the foil without deflection; however, there were also a few particles that were deflected at a small angle or even directed back towards the radium.

Rutherford's deduction of the outcome reveals that the unaffected particles should have passed through empty space while the deflected particles hit something with a highly positive charge. We now know two important things about the atom:

1. The volume of the atom consists of mostly empty space.
2. A small body with a large mass sits at the center of each atom. This is known as the **neucleus**.

Rutherford's model of the atom is widely used today. A simulation of the experiment can be found [here](https://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/electromag/java/rutherford/).

This discovery is what led to the modern model of the atom, known as the **Bohr model** (or Rutherford-Bohr).

## Isotopes

An **isotope** is an atom of the same element but differ in mass when compared to others. This is explained by the discovery of the final subatomic particle: the **neutron**. Isotopes of an element contain the same amount of electrons and protons with the only difference being in the amount of neutrons.

Unlike the electron and proton, the neutron has a *neutral charge*. This makes it a lot harder to detect than charged particles and was later discovered in 1932 by James Chadwick.
