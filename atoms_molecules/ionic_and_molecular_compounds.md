# Ionic & Molecular Compounds

In many chemical reactions, the nuclei of the participating atoms remain unchanged. Their electrons, however, can either be:
- added to atoms,
- lost by transfer, or
- shared with other atoms.

This transference and sharing of particles is the backbone of chemical reactions. With some compounds, atoms can either gain or lose electrons to form what is called an **ion**.

You can use the [[periodic_table|periodic table]] to predict whether an atom will form an **anion** or a **cation**. For example, alkali metals (group 1) will usually form a cation with a 1+ charge, alkali earth metals (group 2) with a 2+ charge, etc. Calcium, being an alkaline earth metal, will lose two electrons to form a cation with a 2+ charge.

Likewise, the same can be said for the right side of the table. Halogens (group 17) will form an anion with a 1- charge, the chalcogens (group 16) a 2- charge, and so on.

When moving towards the center of the table, the group number becomes less reliant. For example, copper can form with ionic charges of 1+ and 2+.

All of the examples above are known as **monatomic ions**, which are individual atoms formed to have an ionic charge.

## Polyatomic Ions

There are many **polyatomic ions**, which are molecules possessing an electric charge. A subcategory of these types of ions are **oxyanions**, which contain one or more oxygen atom.

The table below outlines the most common polyatomic ions, which will be used repeatedly.

Some polyatomic ions have the hypo- and hyper- prefixes as well as the -ate and -ite suffixes. These are used for oxyanions to indicate the amount of oxygen atoms in the compound. However, this naming convention is not consistent.

## Ionic Compounds

When atoms transfer electrons to others in order to form an **ionic bond**, they are known as **ionic compounds**. These compounds generally consist of a metal and nonmetal, though this is not always true (e.g. $AlCl_3$). They can also be identified by their properties, where melting and boiling points are quite high. They are also able to conduct electricity when molten due to their ions being able to move freely.

*All ionic compounds possess a neutral charge since their cation and anion charges are equal.*

Ionic compounds may also contain polyatomic ions as the cation and/or the anion. Compounds that utilize polyatomic ions also follow the rule of possessing a neutral charge. Parentheses are used to indicate a group of ions are used as a single unit; in this case, we use them to indicate polyatomic ions as a single group.

For example, take [calcium phosphate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/24456). It has the formula $Ca_3(PO_4)_2$. For every two $PO_4^{3-}$, there are three $Ca$ present. Their charges also sum up to zero, indicating that it has a neutral charge.

Note that it is improper to use a [[chemical_formulae#Chemical Formulae|molecular formula]] for ionic compounds. The ions that make up the compound must be represented as a whole. Taking calcium phosphate as an example, it is not proper to write $Ca_3P_2O_8$ but must be written as $Ca_3(PO_4)_2$.

## Molecular Compounds

When electrons are shared between atoms instead of being transferred in a molecule, they are called **molecular compounds** (or covalent compounds). Its atoms are held together by **covalent bonds**. To contrast with ionic compounds, molecular compounds usually consists of nonmetals instead of a metal and nonmetal.

*Note that not all molecular compounds consist of nonmetals. Certain outliers do exist.*

## Examples

**Ions**

1. An ion found in some compounds used as antiperspirants contains 13 protons and 10 electrons. What is its symbol?

We know that protons are unchanged when an atom forms an ion, so the element corresponding to number 13 is aluminum. With a loss of 3 electrons, there is an ionic charge of 3+. Therefore, the symbol is $Al^{3+}$.

2. Give the symbol and name for the ion with 34 protons and 36 electrons.

The element with atomic number 34 is selenium. There is an excess of 2 electrons, giving it the ionic charge of 2-. The symbol for this ion is $Se^{2-}$. Its name is the selenide ion.

3. Magnesium and nitrogen react to form an ionic compound. Predict which forms an anion, which forms a cation, and the charges of each ion. Write the symbol for each ion and name them.

Magnesium, being an alkali earth metal, will likely become the cation with an ionic charge of 2+. Nitrogen, on the other hand, will become the anion and have an ionic charge of 3-.

Therefore, the symbols for these ions are $Mg^{2+}$ (magnesium ion) and $N^{3-}$ (nitride ion).

4. Aluminum and carbon react to form an ionic compound. Predict which forms an anion, which forms a cation, and the charges of each ion. Write the symbol for each ion and name them.

Since aluminum comes after the alkali earth metal magnesium and is also further towards the left of the table than carbon, it will likely be the cation with a 3+ charge. Carbon must be the anion with a 4- charge.

The symbols for these ions are $Al^{3+}$ (aluminum ion) and $C^{4-}$ (carbide ion).

**Ionic & Molecular Compounds**

5. The gemstone sapphire is mostly a compound of aluminum and oxygen that contains aluminum cations, $Al^{3+}$, and oxygen anions, $O^{2−}$. What is the formula of this compound?

As an ionic compound, the sapphire's overall ionic charge must be neutral. Since the aluminum has a charge of 3+ and oxygen has a charge of 2-, we get a ratio of 2:3 to obtain the neutral charge.

Therefore, the formula of the sapphire compound is $Al_2O_3$.

6. Predict the formula of the ionic compound formed between the sodium cation, $Na^+$, and the sulfide anion, $S^{2−}$.

To obtain a neutral charge, we get the ratio of 2 sodium atoms to 1 sulfur atom for the formula $Na_2S$.

7. [Baking powder](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/516892) contains [calcium dihydrogen phosphate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/24454), an ionic compound composed of the ions $Ca^{2+}$ and $H_2PO_4^−$. What is the formula of this compound?

The formula would be $Ca(H_2PO_4)_2$.

8. Predict the formula of the ionic compound formed between the lithium ion and the peroxide ion, $O_2^{2−}$.

We can predict that the charge for the lithium ion is 1+ as it's an alkali metal. Therefore, the formula would be $Li_2O_2$.

9. Predict whether the following compounds are ionic or molecular:

a) $KI$

Seeing that potassium is a metal and iodine is a nonmetal, we can assume it is an ionic compound.

b) $H_2O_2$

This is a molecular compound as it consists of only nonmetals.

c) $CHCl_3$

This is a molecular compound as it consists of only nonmetals. 

d) $Li_2CO_3$

This is an ionic compound as it contains a metal and nonmetal.

10. Using the periodic table, predict whether the following compounds are ionic or covalent.

a) $SO_2$

Molecular compound.

b) $CaF_2$

Ionic compound.

c) $N_2H_4$

Molecular compound.

d) $Al_2(SO_4)_3$

Ionic compound.
