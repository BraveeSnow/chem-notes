# Chemistry Notes

This is a collection of my chemistry notes. I highly recommend to clone the repository and use [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to view these notes since it's what I used to create them.

## Recommended Plugins

In case the `.obsidian` folder doesn't automatically import plugins that were used to make these notes, here's the list:

- [Typewriter (theme)](https://github.com/crashmoney/obsidian-typewriter)
- [Chem (SMILES renderer)](https://github.com/Acylation/obsidian-chem)
- [Advanced Tables (Formatting and QoL, optional)](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian)

After that, adjust the plugin settings to your liking. The `.obsidian` folder already has my config, but feel free to change it if you dislike it.

## Contributing

These are personal notes, so I won't be accepting new content. However, if you find any errors feel free to correct them and make a pull request!
